Logic
my profile
1. render page
2. dm list should be everyone but the user
3. able to send message after clicking on dm list buttons

other profile
1. render page
2. no dm list - just chatbox
3. if first time sender
        chatbox = empty
        after send message
        chatbox is updated
    else
        chatbox should populate with chat history

Bugs
1. model rooms name are not unique when two different users join the same room
