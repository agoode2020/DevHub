Mission
-bring together all engineers not just software developers

NEXT STEPS:
-merge text and video chat, make sure the site can have multiple rooms of text and video chat, ringing notification
-read about django testing and implement testing for the models
-have logic to send a specifc type of meeting request
-proposed meeting spot algorithm
-search and filtering
-calendar system/meeting request list
-payment system
-make ui seemless and pretty
-invision secnarious and implement proper pay walls and access walls
-prepare terraform file, create docker, migrate database, push to aws
-test and set up our own accounnts
-bring users to site/advertise and gage retention and brainstorm whats need to make website more seemless and friendly


Key features
-profiles
    1.60 second pitch about you(highly recommened for greater chance of connecting)
    2.status: creator or recruit
    3.if creator: current projects, preferences on collarborating = hybrid, in-person, online
    4.city
    5.online notifier


Core functionalities
-possible meet up spots halfway between(coffee shops, libraries, wework)

Signup:
email/password/dob
to request or join stream meeting must finish required profile fields(this also lets you switch to creator status)


MVP
-devhub.io(this is likely going to be too expensive) or projectpal.io($32/yr on hostinger)(be careful searching domains because they probably increase the price based on hitcount) or developercentral.io
-profile/account(change and add)✔️
-dm system✔️
-friends list
-search and filtering
-live chat system✔️
-proposed meeting spot algorithm 
-meetings/simple calendar page
-rating system/strike system
-something to buy(payment when request to meet is accepted?)
-once someone accepts a meeting invation you two become collaborators(messaging and video calling only become available once two people are collaborators)
-only show the elevator pitch and current projects(basically undentifiable information(censor name in elevator pitch using ai))(to encourage people to meet in person might not pay for meeting invite if they request that type of meeting)
-extensive testing on just functionality for now
-advertising plan


FUTURE IDEAS
-if you sign up for a commited meeting you have to go or you get a strike(reliability score)
-repository
-replit
-kids version
-option to do leetcode probs together on site
-pitch competitions/meetups
-youtube coding interviews and skits on the platform to advertise
